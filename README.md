# 🌱 Optimal Soil Fertilizer Predictor  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Optimal Soil Fertilizer Predictor** is a machine learning-based tool designed to recommend the most suitable fertilizer based on soil parameters. By analyzing factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH level, temperature, humidity, soil type, and crop type, this model enhances crop yield while promoting sustainable agriculture.  



## 🚀 Features  
- **Accurate Fertilizer Prediction** using machine learning.  
- **Data-Driven Insights** for informed decision-making.  
- **Reduces Environmental Impact** by optimizing fertilizer use.  
- **Easy Integration** with mobile apps and IoT devices.  



## 📊 Dataset  
The model is trained on a dataset with **100 entries**, including:  
- **Temperature (°C)**  
- **Humidity (%)**  
- **Moisture Content**  
- **Soil Type** (e.g., Sandy, Loamy)  
- **Crop Type** (e.g., Rice, Wheat)  
- **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)** levels  
- **Fertilizer Name (Target Variable)**
